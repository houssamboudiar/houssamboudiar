Given the increasing need to improve systems functioning in general such as performance,
management and information exchange. The purpose of bringing these autonomous systems
together in order to make the most of their capacities was introduced under the concept ”System of
Systems”.

The difficulty in designing them lies in the complexity resulting from their constituent
systems heterogeneity, each of which has a precise mission to accomplish, and its independent
evolution can cause these systems to behave differently, These changes may affect their interactions
and communications within the **SoS**.

Consequently, it may break the global goal of the SoS. Taking these changes into account from
the design phase is a major challenge for SoS engineering which already suffers from a great lack
in terms of methods and design process.

In such situation, important informations may be lost, exposed to fraud or data tampering, etc. Some technologies have revolutionized exchanges between individuals. In particular, we mention Blockchain **—is a distributed information storage and transmission technology—** collecting information sent by users checked and grouped at regular time intervals into blocks thus forming a chain, the whole secured by cryptography. That makes it an ideal technology to maintain reliable interactions and secured information exchange within the system of systems.

These interactions can be done by adopting smart contracts to facilitate the verification, negotiation and execution
between constituent systems without the need for intermediaries.
